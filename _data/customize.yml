about_detail: "Throughout the years my husband and I have found our passion in designing wonderful art that we hope is enjoyable and at times functional as well. Being creative and artistic set my husband on the path to make a forge several years ago and he started learning how to blacksmith. Since then, he went to school for welding and has combined both to make fun, beautiful, and functional metal art work. In recent years he purchased a lathe and learned how to turn wood resulting in some stunning, fun, and functional pens. Over the years I have dabbled in various hobbies, enjoying many crafting projects. Throughout this journey, I discovered that my passion is in painting using mixed media and flow techniques. My most favorite is using mixed media to make wearable art work. Using resin, paints, pigments, polymer clay, and embellishments I create fun, colorful, and elegant jewelry. With the encouragement from family, friends and customers, we decided to start our web page and hope you enjoy it."
